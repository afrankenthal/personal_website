Andre Frankenthal is a PhD Candidate in experimental high-energy Physics at Cornell University. Originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, he holds a BA from Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, and a MSc from Cornell. Andre works in two different experiments searching for dark matter using complementary strategies: with the larger [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration) smashing protons together at the LHC, and with a smaller team at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Italy, looking for dark photons ([PADME Collaboration](http://padme.lnf.infn.it/)). His work revolves around data analysis, detector data reconstruction, and upgrade studies for the next generation of high-energy physics detectors, in particular the CMS pixel detector.
