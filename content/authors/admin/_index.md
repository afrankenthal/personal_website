I am currently a [Dicke Fellow](https://phy.princeton.edu/dicke-fellows) at Princeton University's Physics department. Originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I hold a B.A. from Reed College, in Portland, OR, and a M.S. and Ph.D. from Cornell University, in Ithaca, NY. I work in two different experiments searching for dark matter using complementary strategies: with the larger [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration) smashing protons together at the LHC, and with a smaller team at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Italy, looking for dark photons ([PADME Collaboration](http://padme.lnf.infn.it/)). My work revolves around data analysis, detector data reconstruction, and upgrade studies for the next generation of high-energy physics detectors, in particular the CMS pixel detector.
