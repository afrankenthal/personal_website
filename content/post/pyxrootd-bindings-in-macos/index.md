The homebrew version of xrootd doesnâ€™t come with python bindings for some reason. The python bindings are needed for reading remote ROOT files with python/uproot (not needed for C++ ROOT).

Adapted from: https://github.com/lgray/coffeandbacon/blob/master/setup_lcg.sh

    # issue with python3 bindings, see https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/SPI-1198
    wget https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/archive/v4.8.3.tar.gz 
    tar zxf v4.8.3.tar.gz && rm -f v4.8.3.tar.gz 
    cp xrd_setup.py xrootd-4.8.3/bindings/python/ 
    pushd xrootd-4.8.3/bindings/python/ 
    python xrd_setup.py install
    popd
    rm -rf xrootd-4.8.3 

Check whatever version of xrootd you have and substitute the numbers above. You can find the xrd_setup.py file {{% staticref "files/xrd_setup.py" %}}here{{% /staticref %}}.

(Or from: https://github.com/lgray/coffeandbacon/blob/master/xrd_setup.py)

My pyxrootd ended up installed here:

    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyxrootd-4.8.3-py3.7-macosx-10.12-x86_64.egg/

To check open up python3 and try to import pyxroot.
